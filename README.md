This project contains my interpretation of the sunlight damage mechanic from a game V-Rising.

In my version the directional light changes its angle over time, creating a day and night cycle that keeps repeating. 
If the player is exposed to the sunlight for a specified amount of time, they will start getting damage every second. 
While if the player is obscured from the sun by a shadow cast by surrounding structures, or currently its night time - they are safe from the sun's damage.
